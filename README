The Rebirth - MaNGOS server
===========================

This is the code base of The Rebirth as it were when the server shut
down in March of 2017. It should be a fully functional MaNGOS server
with all of its shortcomings and the things that were coded during the
lifetime of the Rebirth.

Due to the fallout at the end of 2014 when Muggle and andkem took over
the management of the server all commit history before the start of
2015 is, unfortunately, lost.

Build instructions
==================

Windows

The Windows builds are probably horribly broken, We haven't even tried
them for a while, since at the end of the project's life we had no one
developing on Windows. If you want it to build on Windows you can
expect to have to go through a measure of pain and suffering and no
instructions will be given here.

Linux

On Linux, building should be pretty straight forward.

1. Make sure that you have a compiler installed (clang and gcc should
   both work), make, cmake, ACE and TBB.

2. Create a folder called "build" at the root of the project.

3. In the build folder execute the following command to configure the
   build:
    cmake .. -DDEBUG=0 -DACE_USE_EXTERNAL=1 -DTBB_USE_EXTERNAL=1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/location

   NOTE: If you set ACE_USE_EXTERNAL or TBB_USE_EXTERNAL to 0 it will
         build using the bundled libraries. The bundled libraries
         have NOT been used, ever, by The Rebirth in an production
         environment and we cannot vouch for their stability.

4. Execute "make" in the build folder to start the build process.

5. Install the server in the desired location by executing "make
   install" in the build folder.

Example chain of commands:
git clone git://github.com/Rebirth-MaNGOS/Rebirth.git
cd Rebirth
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DACE_USE_EXTERNAL=1 -DTBB_USE_EXTERNAL=1 -DDEBUG=0 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/Rebirth
make
make install

When the commands above are done the server should be installed in
"/tmp/Rebirth".

You can find the configuration settings the Rebirth used under the
"config_files" folder. Copy these to the "etc", /tmp/Rebirth/etc for
the example above, folder of the installation given as
"CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX" and change the settings as you see fit.

Importing the database
======================

The complete Rebirth database is available in the repo and can be
found under "full_database".

1. Import the SQL-files found under "full_database" into your MariaDB
   or MySQL server:
   mysql -u root -p < zp_mangosd.sql
   mysql -u root -p < zp_realmd.sql
   mysql -u root -p < zp_charactersd.sql
   mysql -u root -p < zp_scriptdevzerod.sql

2. Configure your database with a user that has full access to the
   databases created in the import. The databases are named the same
   thing as the SQL files, but without the file ending.

3. Change all entries in the mangos server configuration files to
   match the login info of your database. Ex: "LoginDatabaseInfo"
   in mangosd.conf.

Extracting DBC files and generating maps
========================================

To get the server to work with pathing working correctly (as correctly
as they can with our MaNGOS version, at least) you need to go through
a few steps.

There are a few tools under the contrib folder:
  - extractor - used to extract maps from a World of Warcraft
    client.
  - vmap_assembler/vmap-extractor - used to created vmaps that deal
    with LOS in the game.
  - mmap - mmap generator that generates the pathing maps.

Build the four different tools the same way you did the server. I.e.
go into the folder, create a new folder called build, enter the build
folder, execute "cmake .." and then run "make".

Example:
cd extractor
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cp ad /path/to/wow/folder

When you have all four tools built, you copy them to a World of
Warcraft client folder. Then you run the following commands in the
World of Warcraft client folder:
./ad
./vmap-extractor
mkdidr vmaps
./vmap_assembler Buildings vmaps
mkdir mmaps
./MoveMapGen

Now copy the following folders to the "bin" folder of your mangos
server install , i.e. the path you gave in the previous step to
"CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX" (/tmp/Rebirth/bin in the example):
 - mmaps
 - vmaps
 - maps
 - dbc

Note: The Rebirth MoveMapGen has a new flag called --dumpTile that
allows for viewing a movemap tile in Blender. See the readme.

Starting the server
===================

If everything has gone the way it should, the server should now be
ready to start. Make sure that your SQL server is up and running and
that you have changed the mangos configuration according to your own
password and username. Then go to the bin folder of your installation
and simply execute "./realmd" to start the realm daemon and
"./mangosd" to start the game server.

If the database was imported as provided and the server started
without throwing fatal errors, you should now be able to log on to the
server using the already existing default GM account with username
"admin" and password "admin". Change your realmlist to "set
realmlist 127.0.0.1" to log on.

DEFAULT GM USER:
Username: admin
Password: admin

WARNING: If you intend on running the server publicly we highly
encourage you to change the password of the default account, deleting
it or disabling it!

Thank you for the good times
============================

Hopefully you can get some joy out of the dirty hacks we have crafted
with love, sweat and some tears during the years, as we now let our
child out into the wild!

Thank you for all the good times we had!
- The Rebirth team!
