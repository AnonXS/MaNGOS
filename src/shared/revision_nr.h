After much study, it appears as though we stopped taking updates from cmangos at
evision z1789.  At first I was haphazardly going threw them and picking stuff out
but since I have confirmed this I will now start going threw chronologically but
here are the ones that were already added:

2479	Restrictions to AQ40 mounts -- note you can leave instance while mounted
2478	Database fix for Paladin Benediction talent Crusader/Command Seals.
2470	Improvement to random movetype.

I will mark ones I skip due to not being compadible:

Skipped due to my own lack of knowledge about how code works:
z1824 -- Supposed to be improvements to specific movement handling claimed neccessary by author
	for proper charge, jump, flightpaths and such -- Might be worth looking at.
z1836 -- Don't understand what this does
